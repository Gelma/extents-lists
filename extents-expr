# extents-expr [-s] <directory>|@<file>... [<operator> <directory>|@<file>...]...
#
# Extents lists are generated from each <directory> and the operators are applied.  The default
# operator used between adjacent directories is "union".  Specifying @ causes the extents to be
# read from an existing file.
#
# Operators are:
#   + union
#   ^ intersection
#   - difference
#
# There is no operator precedence, no parentheses and all evaluation is strictly left-to-right.
# This means that using wildcards or concatenation between directories in the righthand-side
# of an operator will almost certainly not achieve the desired effect (see example below).
#
# If the -s option is specified then the resulting list is automatically sent to extents-size.
#
# Example: to find out how much space is being wasted by keeping historical btrbk snapshots
# of a subvolume called 'cobb' you could use:
#
# 	extents-expr -s cobb.* - cobb.20160815T000602+0100
#
# Or, to find out how much data is shared between two specific snapshots use:
#
#	extents-expr -s Media.20160801T030601+0100 ^ Media.20160815T000602+0100
#
# However, the following expression DOES NOT give the result that is probably intended:
#
#	extents-expr -s cobb.20160815T000602+0100 - cobb.*
#
# The desired calculation was probably to determine how much of the data in the latest snapshot is
# unique to that snapshot (i.e. new).  However the effect is to subtract the first of the cobb.*
# directories and then add in all the rest.  The desired effect would be something like:
#
# 	extents-expr -s cobb.20160815T000602+0100 - ( cobb.* )
#
# but parentheses (and precedence) are not available.
#
# THIS MIGHT CHANGE at some time in the future.
#

# Make sure errors are passed back
